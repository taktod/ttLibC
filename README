  cute test code will be good example to use.

  1st. get the cute 2.0.0 standalone.
  http://cute-test.com/projects/cute/wiki/CUTE_standalone
  
  extract cute2_0_0.tar.gz
  
  copy cute_lib/* in /usr/local/include/cute_lib/

  2nd get the boost.

  in my case. I use brew.

  $ brew install boost
  
  finally try to compile and run.

  $ autoreconf

  $ ./configure --enable-all --enable-test

  $ make

  $ cuteSrc/cuteTest

  will run all test.


  camera with opencv.
  
  $ brew tap homebrew/science
  
  $ brew install opencv
  
  sound play with openal.
  
  $ brew install openal
  
  $ ./configure --enable-all --enable-test
  
  $ make clean
  
  $ make
  
  $ cuteSrc/cuteTest

  will run camera test and beep play test.

  if you want to run specific test. for instance, hexUtilTest in utilTests.

  $ cuteSrc/cuteTest utilTests#hexUtilTest
  
  will work.

  
  if you want docs. doxygen will work.
  
  $ brew install doxygen graphviz
  
  cd docs
  
  $ doxygen ttLibC.doxygen
  
  $ open html/index.html
  
  will display the docs.
